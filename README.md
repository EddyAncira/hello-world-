getting familiar with github repositories

Hi my name is Eddy, I'm trying to get familiar with this repository thing of github
seems nice actually, I like learning new stuff. 
The changes done to master are in order to learn about the branches and so on. 

Hi boys I'm just practicing this thing about repositories
sorry for this Lol
